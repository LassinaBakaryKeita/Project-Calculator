# 🧮 Lassina's Calculator

Welcome to the **Lassina's Calculator** project.  
This is a simple yet powerful calculator built with **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**, providing an interactive and responsive interface for performing basic arithmetic operations.

## 📄 Project Description

The calculator interface is composed of **three main sections**:

1. **Header Section**  
   - Title: *"Bienvenue dans Lassina's calculator"* displayed at the top.  

2. **Display Screen**  
   - Shows the current input and arithmetic expression.  
   - Updates dynamically as users type numbers, operators, or perform calculations.  

3. **Button Grid**  
   - A grid of buttons for digits (0–9), decimal point, operators (+, −, ×, ÷), and special actions:  
     - **DEL** → deletes the last character.  
     - **AC** → clears all input and resets the calculator.  
     - **=** → computes and displays the result.  
   - Buttons are styled for usability and responsiveness.
